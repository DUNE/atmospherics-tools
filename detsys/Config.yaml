Samples:
  - Name: "Default" #Sample Identifier name
    FilePath: "./data/Nominal" #Path to directory which contains the set of CAF files to use for this sample. It will grab all "*.root" files within that directory
    SubDirectoryName: "cafmaker" #The CAF files are expected to contain the 'cafTree', 'meta' and 'genieEvt' TTrees. Sometimes, but not all the time, these TTrees are contained in a subdirectory (i.e. 'cafmaker')

#The way in which variables are grabbed from the MC is as follows:
#First, the [Observables][Axes][Variable] string is converted to an enum here: https://github.com/DUNE/atmospherics-tools/blob/b25e0400f2a571a4e4b6e4bddee58579e7dc37b0/detsys/src/Constants.h#L17-L34

#Second, the mapping of that enum to a CAF variable is done through this function: https://github.com/DUNE/atmospherics-tools/blob/b25e0400f2a571a4e4b6e4bddee58579e7dc37b0/detsys/src/Reader.cxx#L131-L141
#This returns any variable stored in the 'Data' struct: https://github.com/DUNE/atmospherics-tools/blob/b25e0400f2a571a4e4b6e4bddee58579e7dc37b0/detsys/src/Data.h#L6
#Which get filled from the CAF file e.g. here: https://github.com/DUNE/atmospherics-tools/blob/b25e0400f2a571a4e4b6e4bddee58579e7dc37b0/detsys/src/Reader.cxx#L150
